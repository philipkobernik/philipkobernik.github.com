Parked at Narada Falls, walked down past the falls view-point and
followed signs for Reflection Lake. From the lake we hopped on the Pinnacle
Saddle Trail which is clearly defined in the winter by lovely ski tracks. Eventually the trail opened up to a sloping traverse underneath Pinnacle and the crampons came out.

I utilized [10-day weather data](http://www.nwac.us/weatherdata/paradise/10day/) from the weather station at
Paradise to estimate stability of snow-pack. Data indicated 3 days
of sub-freezing (and some sub-zero) temperatures without snow-fall. This was enough to feel confidant about snow travel on slopes like the above.

Upon reaching the saddle, we were rewarded with crystal clear
views of Mt Adams and jagged peaks of the Goat Rocks Wilderness.

Ascending the ridge line towards Plummer, Pinnacle Peak's SW flank commands respect.

From the summit of Plummer, it was hard to know which way to look. Every
orientation offered incredibly stunning views. In the panorama below,
one can trace the entirety of the [classic Tatoosh Traverse](http://ericsbasecamp.net/trips/Tatoosh2/Tatoosh2Map.htm). From
Right to left: Unicorn, Castle, Pinnacle, Plummer (standing on it),
Denman, Lane, Wahpenayo, Chutla, Eagle. Last three are a bit trickier to
discern.
